Sequencing is complete for samples submitted to the RTSF Genomics Core,
Project LEE2795 (Centralia_2014_16S-Tag). This project included 96 samples
of bacterial DNA for 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing. The V4 region of the 16S
rRNA gene (515f/806r) was amplified with Illumina compatible fusion primers
following protocols described by Caporaso, G. et al. and Schloss, P. et al.
After amplification products were normalized using an Invitrogen SequalPrep
DNA normalization plate. Two pools containing 48 libraries each were
prepared from the normalized PCR products. Each pool was loaded on one
Illumina MiSeq v2 flow cell. Sequencing done using a v2 300 cycle reagent
kit, 2x150bp paired end format. I recall that we discussed changing your
original request for PE150 reads to PE250. Unfortunately I did not get this
change passed along to the lab personnel so the runs were done using PE150
as originally requested. You will still have complete coverage of the V4
region (253bp long), there is just less overlap of the paired reads. Base
calling was done by Illumina Real Time Analysis (RTA) v1.18.54 and output of
RTA was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq
v1.8.4. Summaries of each run are attached below.
