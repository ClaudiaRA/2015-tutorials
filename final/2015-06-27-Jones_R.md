##Overarching Goal  
* This tutorial will contribute towards understanding **ecological statistics to analyze and interpret microbial sequencing data**

##Learning Objectives
* Install R and R studio on a personal computer
* Understand what an R package is and how to install it
* Import, manipulate, and export data tables using R
* Differentiate data modes in R, including numeric, complex, logical, character modes
* Differentiate data structures in R, including vector, matrix/array, list, and data frame structures
* Transform and standardize community structure data
* Calculate pairwise resemblance matrices in R to summarize relationships between community structure or taxa occurrences
* Visualize community composition using ordination and clustering
* Test hypotheses about differences in community structure across samples or sites
* Identify correlations between community composition, environmental conditions, and spatial configuration of sites
* Find help and other resources for working with R
